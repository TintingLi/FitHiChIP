1. How to install HiC-pro in the system?
-----------------------------------------

HiC-pro is available through GitHub <https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro> (corresponding documentation is available in <http://nservant.github.io/HiC-Pro/>). The simple way is to either download GitHub archieve in a zipped format, or to clone the repository. Then, user needs to perform the following steps:

	1. (Extract the zipped archieve if downloaded.) Go to the directory containing HiC-pro (generally inside the folder name **HiC-Pro-master**)

	2. Edit the file **config-install.txt** by specifying the path names of required packages.

	3. Type **make configure** in the command line, and press enter.

	4. Once configuration is performed, type **make CONFIG_SYS=config-install.txt install** in the command line, and press enter. Successful execution of this command would install HiC-pro in a folder named **HiC-Pro_*VERSIONNAME***
