# Numerical parameters regarding the execution of FitHiChIP
#======================================

#Interaction type
#1: peak to peak
#2: peak to non peak
#3: peak to all (default)
#4: all to all
#5: everything from 1 to 4. That is, all different types of interactions from 1 to 4 would be computed.
IntType=3

# Size of the bins [default = 5000], in bases, for detecting the interactions.
# default is 5 Kb binning
BINSIZE=5000

# Lower distance threshold of interaction between two segments
# (default = 20000 or 20 Kb)
# that is, interactions < 20 Kb would not be considered for significance
LowDistThr=20000

# Upper distance threshold of interaction between two segments
# (default = 2000000 or 2 Mb)
# that is, interactions > 2 Mb would not be considered for significance
UppDistThr=2000000

# Minimum FDR (q-value) cutoff for significant interaction detection
# that is, loops with FDR < 0.01 would be considered as significant
QVALUE=0.01

#======================================
# Parameters specific to the spline fit employed in FitHiC
#======================================

# In the FitHiC model, this is the max no of equal occupancy bins (Default 200)
# input interactions are divided in these bins according to their genomic distance 
NBins=200

# ****************
# Applicable only for peak to all interactions (where IntType=3)
# value of 1 means that peak to peak (or stringent) locus pairs  will be used for FitHiC distance specific background estimation. Denoted as stringent background or FitHiChIP(S) (refer to the manuscript)
# Value of 0 means all locus pairs (peak to peak or peak to non-peak) will be used for FitHiC distance specific background estimation. Denoted as loose background or FitHiChIP(L) (refer to the manuscript)
# ******* Use 1 if you require very stringent output (only very highly significant interactions would be reported)
# ******* Use 0 if you allow less stringency (higher number of interactions would be reported)
# we recommend using this value as 1 (i.e. using FitHiChIP(S) version when peak to all interactions are reported)
# ****************

# Parameters regarding bias correction
#======================================

# Indicates if the bias correction is enabled (1) or not (0). Default 1 (recommended)

# if 2, ICE specific bias is computed
# default 1

#======================================
# Merging nearby significant contacts generated
#======================================

# the following parameter, if 1, means that interactions close to each other 
# (due to their originating bins are closer) are merged
# to represent a single interaction
# if 0, no merging step is performed
# default: 1
# for peak to all interactions, depending on the loose or stringent backgrounds, the outputs are referred as either FitHiChIP(L+M) or FitHiChIP(S+M)
